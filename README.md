# Project Overview

This repository contains the final working code for this thesis. Please note that the development process involved extensive experimentation and debugging, but only the refined, functional code is presented here for clarity.

## Repository Structure

The codebase is organized into multiple Jupyter notebooks, categorized by research phase and specific topics covered within each phase. You can also find the results (pkl files) in the 'Metrics' folder.

## Data Availability

The experiments is fully reproducible if the necessary data is available. However, the complete options datasets used in this project is **not included** in this repository because it was purchased from Tardis.dev on a per-person basis. For more information about the license, please see [https://tardis.dev/#pricing](https://tardis.dev/#pricing).

If similar data is purchased and downloaded, the provided code can be used to fully reproduce all processing steps and experiments. The results of different experiments in the 'Metrics' folder are available, and the notebooks related to analyzing these metrics are fully reproducible. (Please ensure you update the folder path, typically found at the beginning of the notebooks).

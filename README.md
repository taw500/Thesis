# Project Overview

This repository contains the final working code for the thesis. Please note that the development process involved extensive experimentation and debugging, but only the refined, functional code is presented here for clarity.

## Repository Structure

The codebase is organized into multiple Jupyter notebooks, categorized by the research phase and specific topics covered within each phase. You can also find the results (pkl files) in Metrics folder.

## Notebook Specifics

* **Cell Outputs:** You may notice that some cell outputs are not . This is because these cells were executed in different, larger notebooks during the development process and their final, relevant code was then consolidated here.

* **Embedded Images:** Important output images  are copied and directly embedded within the notebooks. This ensures that crucial findings are immediately visible without requiring execution of cells  that require data.

* **DataFrame Naming:** The primary DataFrame name used within the notebooks may vary depending on the specific phase of the research. 

## Data Availability

Due to several factors, the full dataset used in this project is **not included** in this repository:

* **Size:** The initial raw data is exceptionally large, amounting to several gigabytes per day over a 28-day period. The finalfiltered and processed DataFrame alone is approximately 10 GB.

* **Private data:** The data was purchased by my ING supervisor. If you require access to the data, please contact my ING supervisor directly.
